# Perplexity AI Setup Guide

## Overview
AutoChat now uses Perplexity AI instead of OpenAI, providing enhanced web search capabilities and real-time information access. Perplexity combines conversational AI with web search in a single API call, making it perfect for AutoChat use cases.

2. **Generate API Key**
   - Click "Generate New API Key"
   - Copy the API key (it starts with `pplx-`)
   - Store it securely - you won't be able to see it again

## Setting Up the API Key in the App

1. **Open the App**

   - Navigate to Settings

2. **Enter API Key**
